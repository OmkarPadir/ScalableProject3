# Overview

Multiple vehicle instances (`vehicle.py`) will be running on each pi with 'n' numbers
of coupled sensors defined under (`sensor_data_generators.py`). Each sensor type is 
associated with a range of possible values and broadcast to the neighbouring vehicles
via sockets. The following sensor types with corresponding ranges as defined:
- `pressure` (PSI) : [0, 100]
- `speed` (km/h) : [40, 80]
- `light` : ['day', 'night']
- `Fuel` (%) : [40, 80]
- `Proximity` (position) : [left, right, front, behind] 
- `Brake` : [0, 4]
- `heartrate` (BPM) : [40, 120]
- `GPS` (gps coordinates) : latitude - [-90, 90], longitude - [-180, 180]
- `proximity` (m) : [1, 50]

Each Pi can additionally run a single infrastructure instance (`vehicle.py --node_type=i`)
which acts as both a peer (via sockets) to other vehicles. At minimum, conformant endpoints
serve a JSON object with speed, wiper speed, tyre pressure and fuel data, as well as a list
of other known peers. 


# Dependencies

All the nodes are implemented in Python 3. Vehicle and sensors nodes uses the 
standard library,[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) for providing 
external API, [geopy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/) package is used to calculate
the distance between two nodes/vehicles/infra, [pycryptodome](https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/)
is used for adding encryption to the sending data.
